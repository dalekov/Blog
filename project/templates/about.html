          Hey there! I'm Denis ‚Äî a soon dev-to-be with a passion for clean code, elegant logic, and learning new things every day. üëã
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I'm a 24-year-old curious mind from Bulgaria, currently walking the winding path of becoming a software developer. My days are filled with writing Python, debugging (a lot), and sipping way too much black tea.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I started my programming journey from scratch in April 2024, and it's been a wild, rewarding ride ever since. I'm currently diving deep into backend development through SoftUni‚Äôs Software Engineering track and Angela Yu‚Äôs 100 Days of Python challenge. Between lectures, projects, and self-imposed deep dives into Flask and APIs, I‚Äôve found that problem-solving has become not just a skill, but a genuine joy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I‚Äôm an L1 Technical Analyst at DXC Technology, where I troubleshoot, support, and learn on the front lines of IT infrastructure and I carry that user-first mindset into every bit of code I write. I love building things that are not only functional, but make sense for real people.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a Liverpool fan, a huge music geek, a bit of a gym enthusiast (when I‚Äôm not stuck in a loop of ‚Äújust one more module‚Äù), and I live with my Cocker Spaniel, who‚Äôs basically my debugging partner at this point.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          This blog is my corner of the internet ‚Äî a space for sharing thoughts, projects, lessons, and whatever else feels worth writing about. Some posts might be technical, some might be reflections, and some... just late-night ramblings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Thanks for stopping by ‚Äî feel free to reach out or just read along. Here's to learning, building, and staying curious.
